oops... meant to post this *before* I left town, but I'm out on vacation for the next few weeks and will likely not be answering emails or comments.  I'll be back around the first of the year.  In the meantime, I'd recommend directing support questions for wp-openid to the [wordpress support forums][] or the [diso mailing list][].
