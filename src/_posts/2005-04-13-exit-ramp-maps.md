I'm leaving later this afternoon to drive to Nashville and so I went to 
[google maps][] this morning to double check my directions.  I found a good map of where
I was going and was pretty sure I determined which exit I wanted, but couldn't
quite tell if the exit ramp went the direction I needed.  Google satellite
photos to the rescue...

I also got a nice shot of all the [parking lots][] around the area.  Imagine how
useful that would be for a downtown event.
