okay, so i guess things are beginning to look up... i don't have to take my political science final even though i've
missed more than enough days to require me to; my english professor told the class not to worry about the two quizzes
that some of us missed last week, not to worry about the book that we were all suppose to read but practically no one
read, and that the final was only going to cover this last unit instead of being comprehensive.  still have to do the
calc test this afternoon though :-\
