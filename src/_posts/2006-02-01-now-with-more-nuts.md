Observe -- a flight from San Diego to Memphis with one layover in Atlanta costs $564.  A flight from San Diego to Little Rock with a layover in Atlanta and a layover in Memphis costs $135.  Note that they are the exact same flights from San Diego to Atlanta and from Atlanta to Memphis.

Please explain to me why it costs $429 *less* to fly 137 miles *further*.
