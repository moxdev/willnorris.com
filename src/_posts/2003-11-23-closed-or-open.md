It's early morning<br>
No one is awake<br>
I'm back at my cliff<br>
Still throwing things off<br>
I listen to the sounds they make<br>
On their way down<br>
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash<br>
Imagine what my body would sound like<br>
Slamming against those rocks

When it lands<br>
Will my eyes<br>
Be closed or open?
