It's early morning  
No one is awake  
I'm back at my cliff  
Still throwing things off  
I listen to the sounds they make  
On their way down  
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash  
Imagine what my body would sound like  
Slamming against those rocks  
  
When it lands  
Will my eyes  
Be closed or open?
