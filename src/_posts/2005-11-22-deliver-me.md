Have you ever read a passage for the first time... having read it dozens of times before?  Or met someone for the first time... having known them most of your life?

> All of my life, I've been in hiding  
> Wishing there was someone just like.  
> Now that you're here, now that I've found you,  
> I know that you're the one to pull me through.  
>   
> Deliver me.
