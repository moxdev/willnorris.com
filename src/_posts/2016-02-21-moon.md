[Elisabeth][] got me a [Celestron Ultima 100][] spotting scope for Christmas this past year, and I
finally got to put it to use tonight photographing the moon.  The full moon technically isn't until
tomorrow, but I didn't want to miss taking advantage of the clear night we were having.

I still need to practice a lot to get a really sharp image, both with the slight shakiness of the
tripod and getting the manual focus adjustment just right.  But there's still something really
amazing about seeing it directly through a scope yourself versus just seeing pictures.
