I've finally gotten around to uploading all of our professional wedding photos to our [Wedding Set][] on Flickr.  Additionally, they can be seen [as a slideshow][] or along with all the photos taken by our wedding guests in our [Flickr Group][].  These are full resolution photos, primarily so that family and friends and can order very reasonably priced prints.  Thanks go to Nic Dragomire of [Tamarack Studios][] for such a wonderful job on our photos.

**A note to non-Flickr users**: You will need to have a Flickr account to order prints of any of the photos.  I apologize for that, but the good news is that it's the same as any existing Yahoo! account, which most people tend to already have anyway.
