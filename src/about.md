Hi, Iâ€™m <a href="https://willnorris.com/" class="p-name u-url fn url">Will Norris</a>. I'm a
follower of Jesus, a husband to [Elisabeth][], a father to [Gabriel][], a citizen of the [indie
web][], and a <span class="p-role role">software engineer</span> at <span class="p-org
org">Google</span>.  In that order.

I've been at Google [since 2010][], currently working in the [Open Source Programs Office][]
focusing on projects to make it easier to use and release open source software at Google.  I
previously helped design and build the [Google+ API][], having spent much of my career working on
developing tools and technologies for the social web like [OpenID][], [OAuth][], [XRD][], and
[Activity Streams][].  I also spent a number of years in the enterprise identity management space
working on [Shibboleth][] and LDAP directories at [USC][].  

Almost all of my personal projects these days are [indie web][] related, mostly [written in go][].
I'm also a huge fan of [WordPress][] and their mission to democratize publishing.  Even though I no
longer use WordPress for this site, I still manage other WordPress-powered site, and continue to
maintain a number of [plugins][] and occasionally contribute to WordPress core and WordPress for
Android.

### Contact ###

I can be contacted by email at will @ this domain or by phone at <span class="p-tel tel">+1 (901)
484-9455</span>.  Links to most of my online profiles can be found on my [Google+ page][].  I'm not
interested in hearing about job opportunities.

### Colophon ###

This site is powered by [Jekyll][] with a few [custom plugins][] for cleaner urls and other small
tweaks.  I host my sites on [Google Cloud Platform][] and all of my domains are registered with
[Google Domains][] (which I [highly recommend][]).  Short URLs for my content are resolved using a
small server I wrote called [gum][].  Most images are proxied through my [imageproxy][] server to
handle simple things like dynamic resizing.
