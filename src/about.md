Hi, Iâ€™m <a href="https://willnorris.com/" class="p-name u-url fn url">Will Norris</a>. I'm a
follower of Jesus, a husband to [Elisabeth Norris][], a citizen of the [indie web][], and an
engineer at Google. In that order.

At Google, I work in our [Open Source Programs Office][]; we focus on keeping open source software
flowing in and out of Google. Previously I was an engineer on the [Google+ API][], having spent much
of my career working on developing tools and technologies for the indie web like [OpenID][],
[OAuth][], [XRD][], and [Activity Streams][]. I also spent a number of years in the identity
management space working on [Shibboleth][] and LDAP directories at [USC][].  I'm a huge fan of
WordPress, and continue to maintain a number of [plugins][] and occasionally contribute to WordPress
core and WordPress for Android.

I can be contacted by email at will @ this domain or by phone at <span class="p-tel tel">+1 (901)
484-9455</span>.  Links to most of my online profiles can be found on my [Google+
page](https://plus.google.com/+willnorris/about).  I'm not interested in hearing about job
opportunities.
